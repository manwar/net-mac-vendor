Install this module using the normal Perl module installation steps.

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test # see note below
    make install
    
If you want to read the module documentation before you install the
module, try

	perldoc lib/Vendor.pm
	
After you install the module, you can read the documentation like
any other Perl module.

	perldoc Net::MAC::Vendor
	
This distribution comes with a OUI data file in extras/, although I
make no attempt to keep it up to date. Although the data should not
change, it may not be complete. Although I use this for testing,
you should probably get the latest version when you can.
